Factory Fns in JS -> Its like a function/factory which produces objects

Constructor Fns -> Its job is to create or construct an object

Primitive Types(Number, String, Boolean, Symbol, null undefined) are copied by their value

Objects(Function, Array and Object) are copied by their reference

Hoisting is the process of moving function declarations to the top of the file. And this is done automatically by the JS engine that is executing the ccode.

getters => access properties of an object
setters => change (mutate) them

var => creates function-scoped variables
 ES6 (ES2015): let, const => block-scoped variables
 
 this => references to the object that is executing the current function
			when inside a method(i.e. inside an object) => it refers to the object
			and when in a function => it refers to global object i.e. (window,global)

With call(), apply() and bind(), we can set the this argument for a given function

//Rest operator is used to get variable no. of arguments, it converts the variable no. of arguments into an array
//Rest parameter must be last final parameter
